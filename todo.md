# T0D0

- add a remove
  - maybe similar to edit where we see only the destinations, and we remove the
    ones we don't want to track.
  - doesn't remove local files

- tracking a file in a directory that was already tracked
- the *dest* field in the config should allow for some variables
```
{
  "i3/config": "$HOME/.config/i3/config.template"
}
```
- add `tittle edit a@b` to edit a specific machine's overrides.


- tracking a file or directory with a deep name: `tittle track x -n a/b/c`
