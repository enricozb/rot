# Rot - todo

- tracking a file in a directory that was already tracked
- tracking a file or directory with a deep name: `rot track x -n a/b/c`
- the *dest* field in the config should allow for some variables
```
{
  "i3/config": "$HOME/.config/i3/config.template"
}
```
- add `rot edit a@b` to edit a specific machine's overrides.
